			<p>in the first film there was Once a table and the table had a napkin as the video played on the table and the person disappeared and the napkin floated down and And the screen went grey and then faded in to show a street and the street had a bunch of signs with all of the words “left” on them. Another transition is a butterfly landing on a table and then the camera zooms in and the butterfly's wing comes up and it zooms into the butterfly's wing and it transitions to a starry sky.</p>
			<p>the creator of the film was trying to make the viewer question and talk about decision making. This might be what the Creator was going for and the techniques Used in this film were Used well.</p>
